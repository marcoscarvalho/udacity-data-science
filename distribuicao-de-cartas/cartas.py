When you press Test or Submit, a random set of thirty trials, consisting of
three draws each, will be generated as per the documentation above. You will
calculate summary statistics from these results, and use them to answer a
series of quizzes.

Before submitting, select a seed value. This will ensure that if you need to
come back to this quiz, the results of your random card draws will be the same.
You can also use this seed in the Evaluate Answer section to check your
specific results.
